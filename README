Step-by-step explanation - What does what?
 - The script will ask you for the name of the site that you are registering your account on
 - The script will then ask you for your chosen Username
 - The script will then generate a password for you 
 - After the entire process is done, the script creates a file in the same folder as the script is located in
 - In the file, you can see what site you registered on, what username you chose, and what password you got
 
Recommendation & Warnings:
  - Put the script in a folder of your choice that you can both easily and quickly access
  - If the script & log file is located in different folders, the script will create a new log file,
  to avoid this from happening, please place them both in the same folder
  - People can access your log file if you are logged in or if they have access to your PC, use at your own risk
  - If you want, you can use a password manager app, open the script, when it is done, you can copy + paste
  the credentials from the log file, into the password manager app. This is safer for you since it is harder for 
  other people to get access to your passwords
  
  Please check reviews before downloading password managers, for your own safety
  
Clarification:

I do not have access to the passwords that are generated to you, I will not get access to them either, they are written as a
separate file, thus the only way to look at your file is to get access to your PC.
